In this project, I learned how to design a maintainable, readable, and adaptable software system by building a CRUD Python module that connected to a MongoDB database. This module, which was first implemented in Project One, became the foundation for the interactive dashboard built in Project Two. Writing modular code made it significantly easier to connect the backend to the front-end widgets without rewriting logic. One advantage of this approach was the ability to isolate database operations from the rest of the application, which made the dashboard more robust and easier to debug. This CRUD module can be reused in future Python-based applications that need to interact with MongoDB, especially in use cases such as inventory tracking, event logging, or managing user data.

When approaching problems as a computer scientist, I begin by breaking the requirements into manageable tasks, identifying the inputs and outputs, and planning out the data flow. For example, when Grazioso Salvare requested specific dashboard functionality, I mapped their business requirements directly to dashboard components and CRUD operations. Compared to previous courses, this project required more integration across tools (Python, MongoDB, Dash), which meant I had to think more holistically about the system. In future projects, I would begin with a stronger emphasis on data modelingâ€”ensuring the database is optimized for the queries that the client will rely on most frequently.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems using logic, code, and systems design, and this work has practical impact. My work on this dashboard project helps a company like Grazioso Salvare better understand and act on their animal rescue data. With interactive queries and visualizations, they can more quickly find suitable dogs for rescue operations, evaluate trends, and make data-driven decisions. Projects like this demonstrate how technology can directly support mission-critical decision-making.

# Nurlan Gasimzade ‚Äî CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio.  
This portfolio represents the culmination of my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Southern New Hampshire University**.  
It demonstrates my growth, technical proficiency, and professional readiness through enhanced artifacts in **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms and Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

## üß≠ Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, database systems, and cybersecurity principles.  
This ePortfolio highlights my journey of growth and mastery through three enhanced artifacts that align directly with the **five Computer Science program outcomes**:  
- Collaboration and teamwork  
- Professional communication  
- Algorithmic design and evaluation  
- Innovative implementation using industry tools  
- Security mindset and secure software practices  

I developed the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve real-world problems efficiently and securely.  
Through this program, I refined my skills in multiple programming languages such as **Python, Java, C++, and SQL**, and gained hands-on experience with tools including **MongoDB, Flask, Dash, and GitHub**.  

Each project in this portfolio reflects my understanding of the full software development lifecycle ‚Äî from planning and design to implementation, testing, and deployment.  
I have also learned to work effectively in collaborative environments using Git and GitHub for version control, while improving my ability to document, present, and communicate technical work clearly.

The three artifacts below collectively demonstrate my ability to integrate software engineering practices with algorithmic logic and database management ‚Äî essential skills for success in today‚Äôs technology industry.

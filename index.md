# Nurlan Gasimzade â€” CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio.  
This portfolio represents the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.  
It demonstrates my growth, technical proficiency, and professional readiness through enhanced artifacts in **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms and Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

---

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, database systems, and cybersecurity principles.  
This ePortfolio highlights my journey of growth and mastery through three enhanced artifacts that align directly with the **five Computer Science program outcomes**: collaboration, professional communication, algorithmic design, innovative implementation, and a security mindset.

I developed the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve real-world problems efficiently and securely.  
Through this program, I refined my skills in multiple languages such as **Python, Java, C++, and SQL**, as well as tools like **MongoDB, Flask, Dash, and GitHub**.  
Each project in this portfolio reflects my understanding of the full software development lifecycle â€” from planning and design to implementation, testing, and deployment.

I also learned how to work effectively in collaborative environments, leveraging tools like Git and GitHub for version control and distributed teamwork.  
My communication and documentation skills have evolved through technical reports, enhancement narratives, and presentations that clearly explain the purpose, design, and results of my code.

The three artifacts below demonstrate my ability to integrate software engineering practices with algorithmic logic and database management, reflecting the practical skills required to excel in todayâ€™s technology industry.  
They also show my commitment to building secure, efficient, and maintainable systems.

## Software Design & Engineering Artifact

**Artifact:** `animal_shelter.py`  
**Original Course:** CS 340 â€” Client/Server Development  

### Description
This artifact is a Flask-based web application that interacts with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an animal shelter system.  
The enhancement focused on improving **software design and engineering principles** by refactoring the code for readability, modularity, and maintainability.

### Enhancements
- Refactored the original procedural code into an **object-oriented structure**, improving reusability and scalability.  
- Added detailed exception handling to prevent runtime errors and improve stability.  
- Implemented **secure connection handling** and environment variable management for database credentials.  
- Improved overall user interface responsiveness and code documentation.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Software architecture and modular programming  
- Object-oriented design principles  
- Debugging and exception handling  
- Secure coding practices  

**Course Outcome Alignment:** Demonstrates the ability to design and implement robust and maintainable software systems that deliver value and align with industry standards.

## Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact

**Artifact:** `course_planner.py`  
**Original Course:** CS 300 â€” Data Structures and Algorithms  

### Description
This project uses graph algorithms to detect circular dependencies between university courses and ensure valid course scheduling.  
The enhancement focused on optimizing **algorithmic performance** and improving code clarity.

### Enhancements
- Re-implemented the core algorithm using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for efficient cycle detection.  
- Added **unit testing** with automated test cases (`test_course_planner.py`).  
- Integrated input validation to prevent invalid or malformed course data.  
- Optimized CSV data handling and reduced runtime complexity.

### Skills Demonstrated

## Databases Artifact

**Artifact:** `ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb` (Dash + MongoDB Interactive Dashboard)  
**Original Course:** CS 340 â€” Advanced Programming Concepts  

### Description
This interactive web dashboard visualizes animal data stored in MongoDB using **Plotly Dash**.  
The enhancement focused on applying advanced database and data visualization concepts while improving **security and user experience**.

### Enhancements
- Integrated secure **MongoDB user authentication** via credentials entered in the interface.  
- Added **data-driven Dash tables** and an interactive map visualizing animal rescue locations.  
- Enhanced query performance with compound indexing and optimized read operations.  
- Improved front-end layout for accessibility and professional UI/UX alignment.  

### Skills Demonstrated
- Database connectivity and data visualization  
- Web application development with Dash  
- Secure authentication and query optimization  
- UI/UX best practices  

**Course Outcome Alignment:** Demonstrates the ability to design and implement database solutions that deliver value, ensure security, and support decision-making through data analytics.
